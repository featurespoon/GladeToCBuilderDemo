This project demonstrates the code produced by GladeToC from a Glade XML file.  The example is taken from the gtk3-demo.exe, specifically the Builder example.  The XML file (demo.gui) was taken as the starting point, although some changes were necessary to remove or change deprecated features.
It enables you to compare the use of GtkBuilder and GladeToC to produce what is really a very simple working program.
